<p>Hi I'm Joshua! I am a motivated and detail-oriented Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BS-CpE) graduate from the University of San Carlos, 
eager to apply technical expertise and analytical problem-solving skills in a dynamic work environment. </p>

<p>Passionate about innovation and continuous learning, I seek opportunities to contribute effectively to a collaborative team while advancing 
professionally. With a strong academic foundation and adaptability, I aim to drive meaningful impact and deliver 
results-driven solutions.</p>

<p>I recently came back from the Philippines after graduating college. Now I am currently learning the necessary skills in order
to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. I am currently trying to find a job that'll help support my online classes. What you're
seeing right now is my HTML Website Portfolio project! I am applying what I've learned from my online classes, and making it into
a valuable life skill</p>

<p>I hope I was able to catch your attention with my portfolio. This was a really fun and satisfying project to work on. I aim to
continue learning more web developing skills and become a highly-skilled web developer and make it my future profession. Please do
remember me as an enthusiastic and eager individual who is willing to learn the necessary skills to thrive in any working 
environment. Thank you for reading until the end, and I hope I left a good impression on you~</p>
